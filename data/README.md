# The `\data` Directory: Project Data Summary 

In our project, we use the following data files and Application Programming Interfaces:
Due to the nature of the original US Forest Service Fires data files from Redivis (see report) being over 500 mb each, we filtered down the datasets to the computed summary information/data files stored in this folder. The code used in this process is stored in the source folder in the file data_slim.r

## Data files (TODO: Update/delete for your PROJECT)
|Data File Name | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[US_Fire_Causes.csv](./US_Fire_Causes.csv) | This file contains Description
|[US_Fire_Causes_State.csv](./US_Fire_Causes_State.csv) | Description ... 
|[US_Fire_Freq_Per_Year.csv](./US_Fire_Freq_Per_Year.csv) | This file contains the 
total number of fires per year for each classification calculated from US_Fires_Compiled.csv data file from Redivis.
|[US_State_Fire_Year.csv](./US_State_Fire_Year.csv) | This file contains Description
|[US_State_Fire_Year_New.csv](./US_State_Fire_Year_New.csv) | This file .. Description


## Application Programming Interfaces (API) 
Redivis is a data platform for academic research. The US Forest Service Fires dataset was obtained from Redivis. We downloaded the original three datasets in csv format (see report). We computed filtered/summary information from the US Fires Compiled dataset that are stored in this data folder.
