## Abstract:

Our main concern is the role of forest fires in climate change. This is important because not only are there environmental consequences, but socioeconomic effects as well. To address this concern, we plan to examine a dataset provided by the U.S. Forest Service that contains information about past and recent U.S. forest fires.

## Keywords:

forest fires, climate change, global warming, housing crisis

## Introduction:

Climate change has caused many devastating environmental changes. One of the most significant is the severe intensity and frequency of wildfires. The timing of the fire season has evolved to reach a higher peak much earlier and last much longer. This is especially prevalent in the western United States, where the region is much more fire prone due to composition of its forests and vegetation as well as drier climate. While the record breaking temperatures and dryness from human-caused climate change have increased the ability of fires to start and remain sustained, climate change is not the only cause of forest fires. Forest fires are caused by a variety of different factors including lightning, unattended campfires, equipment use and malfunctions, and discarded cigarettes. Based on data from 2000-2017 from Wildland Fire Management Information and U.S. Forest Service Research Data Archive, almost 85% of wildland fires were caused by humans in the United States (<https://www.nps.gov/articles/wildfire-causes-and-evaluation>). We aim to identify most common causes of forest fires, highest at risk regions for fires, and the impact of forest fires on the environment in order to better inform policy and fire prevention/management efforts.

## Problem Domain:

### Background:

Forest fires are becoming increasingly severe in intensity and frequency across the United States. According to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), each wildfire season from 2020 to 2022 has greatly exceeded the average of 1.2 million acres burned since 2016 in the United States. Unprecedented extreme fire behavior throughout this period has resulted in blazes that have burned entire communities, lasted for months, and surpassed mountain divides and inflammable terrain. As these fires continue to evolve to become more aggressive in response drier and hotter climate, communities and the environment are threatened and lives are lost.

### Environmental Context:

According to a 2022 United Nations reported conducted by more than 50 researchers across the world, the risk of highly devastating fires could increase by up to 57% worldwide, primarily due to climate change. Human-caused global warming and climate change has resulted in record high temperatures and dryness that has resulted in devastating fires. For example, researchers have found that if there was no global warming caused by greenhouse emissions, the 2021 extreme heat wave in the Pacific Northwest would not have occurred. In regions with histories of forest fires, the intensity and acreage of fires has vastly increased. Decreased rainfall and humidity have also increased the flammability of vegetation, increasing the abundance of forest fire fuel, frequency of fires, and span of fires.

### Socioeconomic Context:

Most of the damage caused by wildfires occurs in transitional areas that border businesses and homes as well as undeveloped areas. However, crowding and housing crises have resulted in states restricting development in densely populated cities. More people are moving further away from city centers, where housing costs are lower. Both of these factors have resulted in an expansion in development on the wildland-urban interface (WUI), which is a region near and part of flammable vegetation. As climate change as increases the risk and intensity of wildfires, millions of houses has been built and continues to be built in areas where the risks of fire are highest.\

### Direct and Indirect Stakeholders:

Direct Stakeholders are the general public and wildfire agencies/fire departments. The general public is directly impacted since forest fires can threaten their homes and communities and active fires in a certain range result in severe health risks due to smoke inhalation and reduced air quality. The general public values their personal and asset safety and depends on wildfire protection agencies to successfully eliminate the fire threats. Wildfire agencies and fire departments are direct stakeholders since they both develop and carry out interventions to curb and eliminate fires. Their aims are to ensure the safety of firefighters, reduce/eliminate the fire such that it doesn't harm residents, and the most environmental benefit from the fire is received. Indirect stakeholders include meteorological/climate monitoring agencies,geographical monitoring agencies, and new land development/construction. Meteorological/climate monitoring agencies don't directly monitor wildfires but are impacted nonetheless since wildfires cause changes in air quality, temperature, dryness, rainfall, and other measures of climate and weather. Wildfires can cause long-term changes in the temperament of a region. Similarly, geographical monitoring agencies monitor the composition of forests and vegetation, which are dramatically changed after a wildfire. New land development and construction results in thinner forests and changes in the spread and distribution of fires. Additionally, increased development and expansion of businesses in fire prone areas puts people at higher risk.

### Human Values:

Two main human values that are at the center of this issue are environmental sustainability and safety. Environmental sustainability and safety both exist as driving forces behind the actions taken to resolve fires. The interventions designed to fight and prevent forest fires must balance the impact on the environment as well as prioritizing the safety of people and their communities. For example, in California wildfires are burning centuries old sequoia forests as well as towns and communities. Prioritizing which fires to fight first and how resources are allocated represents a value tension between environmental sustainability and safety. Additionally, choosing which interventions to enact represents another value tension. For example, prescribed burns are encouraged as a way to create more resilient forests, however too many fires put residents and their families at risk.

### Potential Benefits and Harms:

One potential benefit of data and technology driven interventions is implementing more effective interventions that eliminate fires faster while reducing the risk for firefighters and wildfire agencies. This will help eliminate threats before they reach communities and threaten the environment further. This will potentially reduce the need to evacuate people from their homes. Another potential benefit is predicting fire intensity, location, and timing allowing wildfire agencies to better prepare resources and advise residents in these regions. This will also give wildfire agencies the information they need to put preventive measures in place ahead of the fire season. The potential harm of this solution is that it could contribute to creating an algorithm that prioritizes certain fire prone regions over others. An unanticipated consequence is that the criteria that the algorithm uses could have biases that result in inequities.

## Research Questions:

1.  **What is the most frequent cause of forest fires?**

-   Knowing the source of these forest fires is vital in the implementation of prevention strategies. Wildfire agencies will also be able to prepare for the effects of the disaster and even advise citizens about the fires and steps to take.

2.  **Which locations do forest fires most frequently occur?**

-   Recognizing the locations in which forest fires happen the most allows for more attention to these vulnerable areas. This aids in prevention by being more aware of fire hazards and better preparation of fire engines.

3.  **How do forest fires affect the environment?**

-   Climate change is prevalent in the world, and forest fires are one of its greatest contributors because of their disruptive effects. Despite this, there may still be some benefits. It's important to know these consequences to formulate better practices for preventing long-term rising shifts in temperature.

## Dataset:

1.  The dataset on Redivis (derived from the U.S. Forest Service) provides information about U.S. forest fires from 1992 to 2022. It contains data such as fire location, size, cause, etc. Since the concern is climate change, this source will help in the preparation for future fires and their prevention. With this dataset, readers are able to be informed and even use it to create new resources (such as apps) to spread awareness about the world's current state.

## Expected Implications:

One of the expected implications is that we will be able to tell what type of environment and what starts forest fires. Also, in which locations the forest fires grow to be the biggest. This could help someone like the U.S. Forest Service to be able to see which areas are at higher risk of becoming fire hazards so that they are more prepared for them. And what causes the forest fires so that they could put out PSAs to make sure the community is also helping protect the forests.

Another implication would be to help those who live around the area of where fires could start be aware of them so that they could be prepared if they do happen again or try to prevent them from even happening. For example, if someone sees that they live in an area that frequently has forest fires and/or is affected by them, they could be better prepared by getting the necessary gear for it, and also because they know it is possible in their area to be more aware of trying to prevent it from happening.

## Limitations:

In the Statistical_cause column, the cause of the fire, some of the entries can be pretty vague. Like, "Miscellaneous" or "Equipment.Use". Some of the fires have names while others don't.

### Addressing the Limitations:

One way to address the first limitation is to only include the ones that were caused by forest fires that were bigger than one acre. This is because the bigger the forest fire is, the more information there will likely be for it. To address the second limitation would be to address the fires by the location that they were at instead of the name given to them, whether it be the coordinates that were given or the state that they occurred in.
