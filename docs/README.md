All of our project reports can be found in this directory. Our key reports are 
as follows: 


|Report | Brief Description|
|---------------| -----------------|
|[Project Proposal (FIX ME!)](./p01-proposal.md) | This is the initial iteration of our report on analysis of US Forest Fires. This report includes background information about the topic, research questions, datasets, and potential limitations.
|[Exploratory Data Analysis](./index.Rmd) | This report was conducted about the US_Fire_Perimeters.csv and US_Fire_Origin_Points.csv data files from the Redivis US Forest Fires dataset. The report includes 3 summary visualizations about frequency of forest fires, mapping origin points, and causes of forest fires and summary table information about each dataset. However, following the exporatory data analysis, we determined that these two datasets were too insufficient and incomplete in the larger context of national forest fires.
|[Interactive Vizualization](../Interactive_Vis) | This is an interactive shiny web application with 3 visualizations that answer our 3 research questions. The dataset used to build the shiny web app was the US_Fires_Compiled.csv, which contains 1,880,465 observations of forest fires in the United States.
